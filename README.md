Interactive Web Tool & Courseware to Teach the Area Under the Curve Concept

Project Overview

This repository provides an interactive web application, accompanying course materials, and visualization tools designed to teach the mathematical concept of the area under the curve from first principles. The app allows students to explore Riemann sums, trapezoidal and Simpson’s rule approximations, and dynamic visualizations to deepen their intuitive and computational understanding of integration.

Key Features
	•	Interactive Visualizations: Graphically manipulate functions, adjust bounds and step sizes, and observe how approximations converge to the true integral.
	•	Web-Based Modules: Responsive front-end tutorials, backend logic for real-time calculation, and automated feedback for learners.
	•	Courseware Content: Modular lesson plans, quizzes, and explanatory animations to support instructors and self-learners.
	•	STEM Education Focus: Designed to bridge theoretical calculus concepts with practical computation and data-science readiness.
